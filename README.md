Setup via ansible ðŸ¤– Requires `2.5.0+`

![zsh][zsh.png]

## Installation
1. Clone this repo and run `make all` from inside the `dotfiles` directory
	```
    git clone https://github.com/samlehman617/dotfiles.git
    make -C dotfiles all
	```
 
    > The Makefile instructs you on what it requires e.g. `NAME`, `EMAIL`, `Password` (refers to your SUDO password)


### Step-by-step 	
1. Edit the `templates/.gitconfig` file with your own `user.name` and `user.email`, and move it to `home/.gitconfig`

    ```
    [user]
    	name = samlehman617 
    	email = samlehman617@gmail.com
    ```

1. [OPTIONAL] Install `pip`, if not yet installed on the machine
	```
    sudo easy_install pip
	```

1. [OPTIONAL] Install `ansible`, if not yet installed on the machine
	```
    sudo pip install ansible
    
    # [Ubuntu]
    sudo pip install --prefix /usr/local ansible
	```

1. Run the playbook to setup dotfiles, provide `become` i.e. SUDO password
	```
    cd ansible/
    ansible-playbook setup-dotfiles.yml --ask-become-pass
    
    # ... OR when ansible/hosts is not yet symlinked into place
    ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-dotfiles.yml --ask-become-pass 
	```
    > Note: `become` i.e. SUDO password is required to ensure `docker-py` is installed
